      Creating HandPaintedCoconuts.com was a family effort.  This business excursion started when Lorna, our Lead Artist, 
      told one of our family friends who were visiting at the time that she would paint a coconut for them and their family.  
      </h4>
      <h4><br>
      After completion of the coconut we sent it to them and they were in shock to see a coconut delivered straight into their mailbox!  
      Seeing it was a cool idea to send hand painted coconuts, we all decided to make it a business to help subsidize college expenses.  
      </h4>
      <h4><br>
      Being home for the summer, Matthew took on the job of creating this very website to sell these coconuts over 
      the internet.  David took on the business side, securing the domain name, setting up the books and registering the business.  
      Lastly Lorna took on the job of creating the initial inventory (with help from some family and friends).
